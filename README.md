# Snowflake Assignment
The key concepts and Snowflake functionalities mentioned in the document:-
1) Audit Columns in Tables: Suggests adding columns to track when and how data is inserted into Snowflake (elt_ts, elt_by, file_name), teaching about data auditing and lineage tracking.
2) Roles and Permissions: Involves creating roles within Snowflake, managing hierarchical access, and permissions, critical for securing access to data and operations within Snowflake.

3) Warehouse Creation: Requires creating a compute warehouse, assignment_wh, demonstrating how Snowflake separates compute and storage resources, allowing for on-demand scaling.

4) Database and Schema Creation: Covers the creation of a database assignment_db and a schema my_schema, showcasing Snowflake's data organization capabilities.

5) Data Loading: Involves loading data from CSV and Parquet files into Snowflake tables, teaching about Snowflake's data ingestion mechanisms, including the use of internal and external stages.

6) Data Masking: Introduces the concept of Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) by adding masking policies to PII (Personally Identifiable Information) columns, emphasizing data privacy and security.

7) Variant Data Type: Mentions creating a variant version of a dataset, which involves using Snowflake's VARIANT data type capable of storing semi-structured data like JSON, XML, and AVRO.
